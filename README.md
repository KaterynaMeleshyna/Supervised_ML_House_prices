# Supervised_ML_House_prices




In this Supervised Machine Learning project, I delve into a dataset containing housing data to train machine learning algorithms aimed at predicting house prices. Employing a regression approach, the project focuses on predicting house prices, which are continuous variables.

This endeavor serves as a learning experience, allowing me to hone my skills in various machine learning techniques such as feature selection, grid search combined with cross-validation, and the construction of pipelines encompassing preprocessing and modeling stages. By experimenting with a range of models featuring different architectures, I strive to identify the top-performing ones.

Utilizing the optimal model, I then generate predictions to be submitted to an ongoing Kaggle challenge associated with the project.

The project unfolds across four distinct notebooks:

1-Data Preparation and Exploration
2-Baseline Model
3-Feature Selection
4-Model Training and Selection
